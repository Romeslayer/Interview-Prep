# Interview-Prep
Gearing up for interviews? This repository aims to hold all the resources needed to crush your next interview! 

At the time of creating this guide, I am a current student in the Front End program at the Turing School of Software and Design. In an effort to prepare for my first software job search, I've decided to make one giant resource for myself to get ready. 

While this resource will constantly be expanding over the next couple of months, feel free to fork it and use it for your own upcoming interview prep, or Click ⭐ if you like the project!

## Behavioral Questions
Many companies want to get to know YOU. Make sure that your answers reflect who you are as a person. If you are a career changer, sometimes it can help to share why you've made the switch to this new industry! 

1. *Tell me about yourself*

  - I am DéNaje Ferguson, I am a software engineer, and I recently graduated from the Turing School of Software and Design, where I had studied Front End Development. For my free time I like to browse the web, snowboard, rollerblade, ballet and many other activities. I strive to be the best developer I can be, by continually learning new technologies and methodologies from my peers and mentors. I am passionate about how technology influneces our laws. We have the power to create new ways to interact with one another, this leads to new and more complex ways for criminals to steal data or canlead to predatory buisness practices, so I will speak up against laws that refuse to protect consumer privacy and buisnesses that use technology to be unsrupulous. 


2. *What are your weaknesses? What are your strengths?*

  - One of my weaknesses is public speaking, I had never been real good at it and still get the shakes, but I had overcame my weakness by putting myself out there, since the pandemic started, I had lost some of the gains that I acqu

  - For both of these, make sure to highlight how you work to overcome your weakness, or how your strength can play a part in the organization!


3. *Why do you want to be a software developer?*

- I am a software developer becaause I enjoy the challenge and process of creating UI elements. I would like to use my skills to create web apps that are accessible for all users. My previous career had less opportunity for growth within the role, so I enjoy the fact that I can forge my own path with what technologies I would like to learn and techniques to improve my skills.


5. *Tell me about a challenging interaction with a teammate*

- One interaction that comes to mind would be during the process of creating PotSpot, my pot hole tracking application. While we were creating the application one of the group mates were pushing a deprecated tool that helps manage and display google maps to the page. He was adamant about using this tool because there was a step by step tutorial. I had expressed my desire to use a tool that I had found that was supported. The group had decided to push on ahead with the deprecated tool just to get something implemented. On the pull request that would implement the deprecated tool I had linked several issues on the deprecated tool where the devs were pointing to use the tool I had found. To help make the transition easier I took the lead and created the layout to display the map and we were able to create the app.


7. *Tell me about a project you've completed that you're proud of*

- One project I am extremely proud of is Sample Space, a drum pad and sequencer app. I created the class structure and created the sequelizer that is fully accessible for screen readers. I uses WAI ARIA roles to define which buttons were associated with each sound and the index it would play. 


9. *Tell me about a problem you faced and how you solved it*
10. *Tell me about a time you were under pressure- how did you handle it?*
11. *What motivates you?*
12. *What is the most helpful feedback you've ever received about yourself?*
13. *Why should we hire you?*
14. *How do you stay organized?*

24. *Describe a situation when you worked effectively under pressure*
25. *Tell me how you solve a problem*
26. *What is your approach to working on a team?*
27. *What is something that your hobbies or interests tell me about you that your resume cannot?*
28. *Sometimes it’s just not possible to get everything on your to-do list done. Tell me about a time your responsibilities got a little overwhelming. What did you do?*
29. *Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it*
30. *Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?*
31. *Imagine you're tasked with organizing a team bonding offsite activity. Some teammates have expressed concerns about the selected activity not being inclusive enough. What kind of actions can you take to ensure that every member of the team feels included, and how can you follow up with your teammates who have expressed concerns?*

## Technical Challenges
Here are some short, simple technical challenges to get started. Consider talking through how you would approach these problems, and then try them for yourself in your console (you'll need to write test cases).

1. *Is Unique* Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. 
2. *URLify* Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with "%20". 
3. *Is Prime* Write a method to determine if an int `n` is a Prime number.
4. There are `n` kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the `ith` kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies that you have. Return a boolean array result of length `n`, where `result[i]` is true if, after giving the `ith` kid all the `extraCandies`, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.
5. Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

## Coding Challenge Resources
There are plenty of coding challenge resources on the web that will help you work through problems that you might see in a technical interview challenge. Here are just a few!

- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
  - Many interviews will have "leetcode-esque" type questions. It could be helpful to get used to seeing problems written out in this structure.
- [Codewars](https://codewars.com/)
- [Codesignal](https://codesignal.com/developers/interview-practice/)
  - Similar to leetcode in structure, practice tests refresh every 24 hours. There is also an arcade mode where you can test your skills.
-[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contests)
  - Div 2 and Div 3 questions A,B should be reasonable (under contests => contest history)
  - Requires command line processing
-[Kattis, Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)
  - Requires command line processing
- [Problem Solving Techniques for Programming Problems and Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4TgqWbKRtA&ab_channel=TechWithTim)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) -These can be quite mathy, but the first few 10 or so problems will be helpful if you can recognize the patterns
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) - The first couple days of problems are really good practice and should be manageable to solve (you can look at previous year's problems too)
- [CodingJS](https://the-winter.github.io/codingjs/) -Pretty straightforward problems that are broken down into data types, really helpful!


## Algorithm Resources
Having an understanding of algorithms and data structures could make your interviewing process much easier, and will help you in the long run during your programming career. Often programming challenges will be based upon a simple algorithm, and being able to recognize which algorithm can be used will save you time during your interview. 

- [Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Repo](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms)
- [Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-data-structures) - You will need to scroll down to find this section.
- [Algorithms in JavaScript](https://medium.com/siliconwat/algorithms-in-javascript-b0bed68f4038)


## BigO Resources
Big O describes the performance or time complexity of a program (that is, the execution time required or space used to run your algorithm). Many technical questions will be bound by a certain limitations in regards to how quickly or efficiently your solution needs to run. 

- [Turing Big O Lesson](https://mod4.turing.edu/lessons/cs/big-o.html)
- [Turing Big O Part 2](https://mod4.turing.edu/lessons/cs/big-o-part-ii.html)
